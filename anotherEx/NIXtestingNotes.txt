1. never fail

5 test: hardcopy - where will the user do the scanning - office scanner (Dol.) -> goes to another app -> fileNet (different way but same effect) -
potential issue: drive location where we pick it up / establish U drive folder is in our list

NIX application access - Jay/Roger

nov, 22th
Dolores does it usually /smoke test/ and run team is there if needed - Brenda and Moreen will stand by to see if they can log in 
and then give it to the rest to test it

basic integrated smoke test - login and retrieval - 19th; 16th is too early; NIX run team to be ready /Liz to inform them/

mail from Liz:
especially SAP id /2.a.2/: conversion to SAP is not part of the cutover (Liz)
after the migration:
SAPID for login to NIX -> URL prompt -> 
CID for retrieval /login to fileNet/ - these are the steps to be proved on 19th of nov

SAPID consistently in the new NIX, when SSO is at place - not in our scope right now

dec 11th - cutover (Liz) - blocker to that is the run team availability / hypercare plan, latest dec 16th

create service accounts in our AD - Venkat is to establish
why so many groups - Dolores is not sure of the abbreviations /MOE, etc./
driver on NIX server 'looks' for new docs every min
check whether the AD groups are still applicable - Jay
NIX - fileNet set up  - Jay
